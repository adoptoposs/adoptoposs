Adoptoposs offers a platform to put your open source
projects up for adoption and make initial contact with
potential co-maintainers.

**Having a team of multiple maintainers is good for you and your project, because:**

* The workload can be split up between all maintainers
* It's easier to take decisions as a team
* There will be no single point of failure
* It is possible to step down as a maintainer
